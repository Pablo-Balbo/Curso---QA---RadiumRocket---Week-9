This week on the QA course we view validation functions in .js files.
This repository have two .html files related named "register.html" and "login.html", each one with that share the same .css file for styles.
There's also two .js files, each corresponding and related to it's .html file.
The project is still in progress, because i want to optimize the code adding a .js file with all the exported functions, and imported them on the register.html file and the login.js file. I am asking about this, so it should be fixed soon.

This project was created and carried out by Pablo A. Balbo, a Radium Rocket QA course student.
