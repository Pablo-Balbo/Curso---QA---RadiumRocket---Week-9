Week 9:
This week on the QA course we view validation functions in .js files.
This repository have two .html files related named "register.html" and "login.html", each one with that share the same .css file for styles.
There's also two .js files, each corresponding and related to it's .html file.
The project is still in progress, because i want to optimize the code adding a .js file with all the exported functions, and imported them on the register.html file and the login.js file. I am asking about this, so it should be fixed soon.

This project was created and carried out by Pablo A. Balbo, a Radium Rocket QA course student.

Week 10:
This week I added Event Listeners to my code, generating a validation of the form when the submit event was executed.
An HTTP request was also made through fetch.
I still could not export functions from the testFunctions.js file, so they were not imported into the register.js and login.js files to optimize the code.

TODO:
Export functions from testFunctions.js;
Import helper functions in register.js and login.js;
The submit event sends the data entered to a div below the form, but when this button is pressed again, the data is entered again, accumulating to the previous ones instead of replacing them.
